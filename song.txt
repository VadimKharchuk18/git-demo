You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another Bloody Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross

If you choose to run away with me
I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that

Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
(Mary on a) Mary on a cross
