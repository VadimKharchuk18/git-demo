You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another Bloody Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross

If you choose to run away with me
I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that

Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
(Mary on a) Mary on a cross

We were speeding together
Down the dark avenues
But besides of the stardom
All we got was blues

But through all of that sorrow
We were riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I never let you go, let you go
