You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another Bloody Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross

If you choose to run away with me
I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that

Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
(Mary on a) Mary on a cross

We were searching for reasons
To play by the rules
But we quickly found
It was just for fools

Now through all of this sorrow
We'll be riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I never let you go, let you go
